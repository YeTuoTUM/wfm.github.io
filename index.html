<h2 id="temperature-and-plant-growth">Temperature and Plant Growth</h2>
<p><strong>Key term:</strong> Temperature ranges (minimum, optimum, maximum) govern plant growth rates.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Temperature significantly influences plant growth, with each plant having its own temperature range consisting of minimum, optimum, and maximum temperatures. Growth begins only after reaching the minimum temperature, accelerates with increasing temperature up to the optimum, and slows down beyond that until growth ceases at the maximum temperature.</p>

<h2 id="development-of-heat-unit-theory">Development of Heat Unit Theory</h2>
<p><strong>Key term:</strong> Heat unit theory</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Heat unit theory was developed to optimize planting times for consistent sweet pea harvests in the 1920s and 1930s. This theory quantifies plant heat requirements based on the accumulation of daily mean temperatures above the base temperature, ensuring optimal planting times for steady harvests.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="heat-unit-theory-and-plant-development">Heat Unit Theory and Plant Development</h2>
<p><strong>Key term:</strong> Heat units</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Heat units, calculated from daily mean temperatures above the base temperature, quantify plant heat requirements. This theory allows for the calculation of total heat units needed for crop maturity by recording daily mean temperatures and determining the excess above the base temperature.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="swats-heat-index-method">SWAT's Heat Index Method</h2>
<p><strong>Key term:</strong> Direct summation index</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> SWAT employs a direct summation index for calculating heat units, where each degree above the base temperature is considered one heat unit. This method assumes a proportional relationship between temperature increase and growth rate but does not consider the detrimental effects of excessively high temperatures on plant growth.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="application-and-example">Application and Example</h2>
<p><strong>Key term:</strong> Heat unit accumulation</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Heat unit accumulation is calculated based on mean daily temperatures exceeding the base temperature. An example is provided to illustrate the application of heat unit theory, emphasizing the importance of suitable temperatures for crop growth and providing a specific equation for calculating heat units.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="visualization-and-conclusion">Visualization and Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>Key term:</strong> Mean daily temperatures</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Mean daily temperatures plotted against the base temperature aid in visualizing suitable days for crop growth. The conclusion reiterates the importance of mean daily temperature exceeding the base temperature for crop growth, ensuring optimal conditions for plant development.</p>
